=Requiremements.

ITK 4.5 with V3 compatibility. It will probably work with version 4.8.2

Use cmake to configure the variables where you installed ITK and configure the project.
When you are done configuring the project type make.

The project will generate an executable called optimizationTexture
type ./optimizationTexture for an example on how to use the program.
